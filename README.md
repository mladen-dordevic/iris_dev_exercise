# iris_dev_exercise

## Overview

This is a simple exercise designed to assess a developers coding and decision
skills. By it's nature the exercise is vague and open-ended - we are interested
to see how you approach and solve the challenge, and what assumptions you
make. You will be asked about your coding decisions during the interview.

## Tasks

1. Clone/fork this repository
2. Build a simple web application as outlined below
3. Commit to Github
4. In a new file SPECS.md explain your design decisions, assumptions, etc.

## Web Application Specification

IRIS commonly works with earthquake data. We would like you to
use the data provided by the [IRIS Event Web Service](http://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/event/1/)
to create a web-based application that displays earthquake locations on a map.

Specifically, when the user clicks any location on the map, we want
earthquake locations within 1000 km of that location to be plotted.
